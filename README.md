# CodSoft Data Science Internship

Welcome to the CodSoft Data Science Internship repository! This repository contains all the projects, assignments, and resources related to the CodSoft Data Science Internship program.

## Overview

This one-month virtual internship focuses on three primary tasks where participants will build predictive models and go a step further by creating web interfaces using Python and Flask. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with real-world datasets, develop skills in Python programming, data manipulation, machine learning, and web development.

## Contents

- **Tasks**: Three main tasks designed to provide practical experience in building predictive models and deploying them using Flask.
- **Resources**: Additional materials such as tutorials, cheat sheets, and references to help you along the way.

## Tasks

1. **Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - Objective: Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
   - Skills: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation.
   - Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask.
   - Description: Create a predictive model and deploy it using a web interface with Flask.

2. **Task 2: Iris Data Classification**
   - Objective: Classify iris flower species based on given features.
   - Skills: Data visualization, classification algorithms, model evaluation.
   - Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask.
   - Description: Build a classification model and develop a web interface for it using Flask.

3. **Task 3: Sales Prediction**
   - Objective: Predict future sales using historical data.
   - Skills: Time series analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation.
   - Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask.
   - Description: Create a sales prediction model and deploy it with a web interface using Flask.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thirupy/codsoft.git
   cd codsoft
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**: 
   Ensure you have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Tasks**:
   Navigate to the `tasks` directory to find detailed instructions and notebooks for each task.
